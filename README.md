# rest_api_project

Built a Netflix Catalgoue REST API server to allow sending HTTP requests to the server and recieving back response object with requested data. Built filtering method to query for a specific film, genre, actor, etc and return films that correspond.

### How to Set Up the REST API server to test out the project I built:
1) Clone/Download the project to your local folder/directory
2) Install all the node_modules that are in the netflix-app/node)modules
3) If you do not want to install all node_modules, just install nodemon, express, joi modules
4) After installed, run nodemon server.js and go to http://localhost:3000/
5) The REST API is up and running, send some requests to it. You can also use POSTMAN app to send requests to it too.
